# Options-Trading-Strategies-in-Python

I have Created code for Options Trading based on Various Trading Technical Indicators.

1. Volatility Index (VIX) based Strategy
2. Put / Call Ratio (PCR) based Strategy
3. Trading Index (TRIN) based Strategy
4. Turtle Trading based Strategy

Still working on more advanced Strategies based on **Black Scholes Merton Option Pricing**. Next I will work on incorporating **Time Series** and **Neural Networks** (RNNs to be specific) to improve accuraacy (Decrease Standard Deviation from current models) and Perfomance.  

**Help & Motivate my work by little generosity:**
